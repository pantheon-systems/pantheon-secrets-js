    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository's code.
      # This action checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE,
      # so your workflow can access it.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js.
      # This action sets up a Node.js environment with the specified version.
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20.x' # It's good practice to specify a major version.

      # Step 3: Install dependencies.
      # `npm ci` is a clean install and is generally faster and more reliable
      # in CI/CD environments than `npm install`. It requires a `package-lock.json` file.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run the tests.
      # This command uses the test script defined in your package.json.
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
